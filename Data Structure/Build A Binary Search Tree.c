/*
Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, 
there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST. 
You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of that tree. 

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. 
For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (â‰¤100) which is the total number of nodes in the tree. 
The next N lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the format left_index right_index, 
provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1, and 0 is always the root. 
If one child is missing, then -1 will represent the NULL child pointer. 
Finally N distinct integer keys are given in the last line.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree. 
All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

**build a Binary Search Tree by judging -1**
**sort the input data, and put each of them in order**

Sample Input:
9
1 6
2 3
-1 -1
-1 4
5 -1
-1 -1
7 -1
-1 8
-1 -1
73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42

Sample Output:
58 25 82 11 38 67 45 73 42
