/*
An inorder binary tree traversal can be implemented in a non-recursive way with a stack. 
For example, suppose that when a 6-node binary tree (with the keys numbered from 1 to 6) is traversed, 
the stack operations are: push(1); push(2); push(3); pop(); pop(); push(4); pop(); pop(); push(5); push(6); pop(); pop(). 
Then a unique binary tree (shown in Figure 1) can be generated from this sequence of operations. 
Your task is to give the postorder traversal sequence of this tree.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. 
For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (â‰¤30) which is the total number of nodes in a tree (and hence the nodes are numbered from 1 to N). 
Then 2N lines follow, each describes a stack operation in the format: 
"Push X" where X is the index of the node being pushed onto the stack; or "Pop" meaning to pop one node from the stack.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the postorder traversal sequence of the corresponding tree in one line. 
A solution is guaranteed to exist. 
All the numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

**the node to insert is 'flag', the last node accessed by stack**

Sample Input:
6
Push 1
Push 2
Push 3
Pop
Pop
Push 4
Pop
Pop
Push 5
Push 6
Pop
Pop
Sample Output:
3 4 2 6 5 1
